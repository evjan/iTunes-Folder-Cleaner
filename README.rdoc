== iTunes Folder Cleaner
This tiny script removes all folders that do not contain an audio file. This is due to iTunes leaving a lot of folders like that when you let it organize your collection.

== Isn't this overkill?
Probably. Someone who's good at bash scripting would be able to yank this behavior out within minutes. But it was a good small project for me to play with Cucumber and RSpec.
